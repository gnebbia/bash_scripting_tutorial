The Useless Use of Cat Award
</a></h2>
The venerable
<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/~merlyn/">Randal L. Schwartz</a>
hands out Useless Use of Cat Awards from time to time; 
you can see some recent examples in 
<a href="http://search.dejanews.com/dnquery.xp?QRY=&amp;ST=PS&amp;DBS=1&amp;defaultOp=AND&amp;maxhits=25&amp;format=terse&amp;showsort=date&amp;groups=&amp;authors=&amp;subjects=useless+%26+use+%26+cat+%26+award&amp;fromdate=Jan+1+1970&amp;todate=">Deja News.</a>
(The subject line really says "This Week's Useless Use of Cat Award" 
although the postings are a lot less frequent than that nowadays). 
The actual award text is basically the same each time, and the ensuing 
discussion is usually just as uninteresting, but there are some refreshing
threads there among all the flogging of this dead horse. 
<p>
The oldest article Deja News finds is from 1995, but it's actually a 
followup to an earlier article. By Internet standards, this is thus 
an Ancient Tradition.
</p><p>
Exercise: Try to find statistically significant differences between 
the followups from 1995 and the ones being posted today. 
</p><p>
(See below for a
<a href="#uucaletter">reconstruction of the Award text.)</a>
</p><p>
Briefly, here's the collected wisdom on using <tt>cat</tt>:
</p><blockquote>
The purpose of <tt>cat</tt> is to concatenate (or "catenate")
files. If it's only one file, concatenating it with
nothing at all is a waste of time, and costs you a process.
</blockquote>
The fact that the same thread ("but but but, I think it's cleaner /
nicer / not that much of a waste / my privelege to waste processes!")
springs up virtually every time the Award is posted is also Ancient
Usenet Tradition.
<p>
Of course, as Heiner points out, using <code>cat</code> on a single
file to view it from the command line is a valid use of <code>cat</code>
(but you might be better off if you get accustomed to using <code>less</code>
for this instead).
</p><p>
In a recent thread on <code>comp.unix.shell</code>, the following
example was posted by Andreas Schwab as another Useful Use of Cat 
on a lone file:
</p><blockquote><pre>	{ foo; bar; cat mumble; baz } | whatever
</pre></blockquote>
Here, the contents of the file <code>mumble</code> are output
to stdout after the output from the programs <code>foo</code> and
<code>bar</code>, and before the output of <code>baz</code>. All
the generated output is piped to the program <code>whatever</code>.
(Read up on shell programming constructs if this was news to 
you&nbsp;<code>:-)</code>
<h2>
Other Fun Awards
</h2>
This could evolve into a good listing of "don't do that" shell 
programming idioms. 
<h3>
<a name="kill">
Useless Use of Kill -9
</a></h3>
Randal also posts his 
<a href="http://search.dejanews.com/dnquery.xp?QRY=&amp;ST=PS&amp;DBS=1&amp;defaultOp=AND&amp;maxhits=25&amp;format=terse&amp;showsort=score&amp;groups=&amp;authors=&amp;subjects=useless+%26+use+%26+kill&amp;fromdate=Jan+1+1970&amp;todate=">Useless Use of Kill -9 Award</a>
although much less frequently.
<p>
(See below for a
<a href="#uuk9letter">reconstruction of the Award text.</a>
It explains the issues clearly enough.)
</p><h3>
<a name="echo">
Useless Use of <code>echo</code>
</a></h3>
<p>
This is really a special case of
<a href="#backticks">Useless Use of Backticks</a>
but it deserves its own section because it's something you see
fairly frequently.
</p><p>
The canonical form of this is something like
</p><blockquote><pre>	variable="something here, or perhaps even the result of backticks"
	some command -options `echo $variable`
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Depending a little bit on what exactly you have the variable for, 
this can be reduced at least to
</p><blockquote><pre>	variable="something here, or perhaps even the result of backticks"
	some command -options $variable
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and there is often no real reason to even think of using echo in backticks
when the simpler construct will do.
</p><p>
(There is a twist: <code>echo</code> will "flatten" any whitespace in
<code>$variable</code> into a single space -- unless you double-quote
<code>$variable</code>, of course --, and sometimes you can legitimately
use echo in backticks for this side effect. But that's rarely necessary or
useful, and so most often, this is just a misguided use of echo.)
</p><p>
There is another example in the next section, and a longer rant about
<a href="#backticks">Useless Use of Backticks</a>
further down the page. There is also a parallel, slightly different
example on the
<a href="http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award-example-backticks.html#echo-backticks">Backticks Example page</a>
</p><h3>
<a name="ls">
Useless Use of <code>ls *</code>
</a></h3>
<p>
Very clever. Usually this is seen as part of a <code>for</code> loop:
</p><blockquote><pre>	for f in `ls *`; do
		command "$f"   # newbies will often forget the quotes, too
	done
</pre></blockquote>
Of course, the <code>ls</code> is not very useful. It will just waste
an extra process doing absolutely nothing. The <code>*</code> glob
will be expanded by the shell before <code>ls</code> even gets to
see the file names (never mind that <code>ls</code> lists all files by
default anyway, so naming the files you want listed is redundant here).
<p>
Here's a related but slightly more benign error
(because <code>echo</code> is often built into the shell):
</p><blockquote><pre>	for f in `echo *`; do
		command "$f"
	done
</pre></blockquote>
But of course the backticks are still useless, the glob itself already
does the expansion of the file names. (See
<a href="#echo">Useless Use of <code>echo</code></a>
above.) What was meant here was obviously
<blockquote><pre>	for f in *; do
		command "$f"
	done
</pre></blockquote>
Additionally, oftentimes the command in the loop doesn't even need to
be run in a for loop, so you might be able to simplify further and say
<blockquote><pre>	command *
</pre></blockquote>
A different issue is how to cope with a glob which expands into file
names with spaces in them, but the for loop or the backticks won't
help with that (and will even make things harder). The plain glob
generates these file names just fine;
<a href="http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award-example-ls.html">click here for an example.</a>
See also 
<a href="#backticks">Useless Use of Backticks</a>
<p>
Finally, as Aaron Crane points out, the result of <code>ls *</code>
will usually be the wrong thing if you do it in a directory with
subdirectories; <code>ls</code> will list the contents of those
directories, not just their names.
</p><h3>
<a name="wc">
Useless Use of <code>wc -l</code>
</a></h3>
This is my personal favorite. There is actually a whole class of 
"Useless Use of (something) | grep (something) | (something)" 
problems but this one usually manifests itself in scripts riddled
by useless backticks and pretzel logic. 
<p>
Anything that looks like
</p><blockquote><pre>	<var>something</var> | grep '..*' | wc -l
</pre></blockquote>
can usually be rewritten like something along the lines of 
<blockquote><pre>	<var>something</var> | grep -c .   # Notice that . is better than '..*'
</pre></blockquote>
or even (if all we want to do is check whether <var>something</var>
produced any non-empty output lines)
<blockquote><pre>	<var>something</var> | grep . &gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; ...
</pre></blockquote>
(or <code>grep -q</code> if your grep has that). 
<p>
If <var>something</var> is reasonably coded, it might even already
be setting its exit code to tell you whether it succeeded in doing
what you asked it to do; in that case, all you have to check is
the exit code:
</p><blockquote><pre>	<var>something</var> &amp;&amp; ...
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
I used to have a really wretched example of clueless code 
(which I had written up completely on my own, to protect the innocent)
which I've moved to a 
<a href="http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award-example-backticks.html">separate page</a>
and annotated a little bit. It expands on the above and also has a 
bit about useless use of backticks
<a href="#backticks">(q.v.)</a>
</p><p>
Here's a contribution I got from Aaron Crane (thanks!):
</p><blockquote>
<code>grep -c</code> can actually solve a large class of problems that
<code>grep | wc -l</code> can't.
If what interests you is the count for each of a group of files,
then the only way to do it with <code>grep | wc -l</code> is
to put a loop round it. So where I had this:
<blockquote><pre>	grep -c "^~h" [A-Z]*/hmm[39]/newMacros
</pre></blockquote>
the naive solution using <code>wc -l</code> would have been
<blockquote><pre>	for f in [A-Z]*/hmm[39]/newMacros; do
	    # or worse, for f in `ls [A-Z]*/hmm[39]/newMacros` ...
	    echo -n "$f:"
	    # so that we know which file's results we're looking at
	    grep "^~h" "$f" | wc -l
	    # gag me with a spoon
	done
</pre></blockquote>
and notice that we also had to fiddle to get the output in a
convenient form.
</blockquote>
<h3>
<a name="grep">
Useless Use of grep | awk and grep | sed
</a></h3>
Here's another one:
<blockquote><pre>ps -l | grep -v '[g]rep' | awk '{print $2}'
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<small>
(Of course, this is merely an example. If you have <code>lsof</code>
it's probably a better solution to this particular problem; also 
the output of <code>ps</code> varies wildly from system to system
so you might want to print something else than <code>$2</code> and
use completely different options to <code>ps</code>.)
</small>
</p><p>
Remember that <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> are 
glorified variants of <code>grep</code>. 
So why use grep at all?
</p><blockquote><pre>ps -l | awk '!/[a]wk/{print $2}'
</pre></blockquote>
Usually you'd like the regex to be tighter than this, 
especially if your login might happen to include the letters 
<code>grep</code> or <code>awk</code>&nbsp;...
<p>
<small></small></p><blockquote><small>
True Story from Real Life: an older version of the GNATS system would
think my real name was "System Operator" because it just went looking
for the first occurrence of the letters e-r-a in the
<code>/etc/passwd</code> file. (Well, actually, it thought my name was 
"System Era". It took me a while to figure out how it arrived at this 
somewhat whimsical conclusion. Incidentally, you also have to wonder 
why the author thought my real name was worth knowing, and if this is 
the right way to get that information. The end goal was to produce a
template for an e-mail message -- perhaps my MUA would already know
my real name, and even be able to produce nice e-mail headers for GNATS?)
</small></blockquote>
<h3>
<a name="backticks">
Useless Use of Backticks
</a></h3>
This is a sort of meta-award, or a corollary of several of the others. 
It merely consists of the general observation that shell scripts with
lots of backticks in them are often possible to optimize and clean up
a lot.
<p>
The
<a href="http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award-example-backticks.html">cluelessness example (I've put it on a separate page)</a>
contains a lot of badly chosen backticks and a somewhat longer
discussion of what exactly they can accomplish, and some ideas for
how to do it differently.
</p><p>
Obviously, backticks are a valid construction, and you can put them
to good use in many shell scripts. I have simply noticed that newbie
scripters often generously treat backticks as the hammer for all those
nails they see.
</p><h4>
<a name="arg-max">
Dangerous Backticks
</a></h4>
A special idiom to pay attention to, because it's basically always wrong,
is this:
<blockquote><pre>	for f in `cat file`; do
	    ...
	done
</pre></blockquote>
Apart from the classical
<a href="#cat">Useless Use of Cat</a>
here, the backticks are outright dangerous, unless you <b>know</b>
the result of the backticks is going to be less than or equal to how
long a command line your shell can accept. (Actually, this is a kernel
limitation. 
<a href="http://porkmail.org/era/unix/arg-max.html">The constant <tt>ARG_MAX</tt> in your <tt>limits.h</tt></a>
should tell you how much your own system can take. POSIX requires 
<tt>ARG_MAX</tt> to be at least 4,096 bytes.)
<p>
Incidentally, this is also one of the Very Ancient Recurring Threads
in
<a href="news:comp.unix.shell"><tt>comp.unix.shell</tt></a>
so don't make the mistake of posting anything that resembles this.
</p><p>
The right way to do this is
</p><blockquote><pre>	while read f; do
	    ...
	done &lt;file
</pre></blockquote>
or, in cases where the command in backticks was something more 
complicated than a (Useless Use of) <tt>cat</tt> of a single file,
<blockquote><pre>	command that used to be in backticks |
	while read f; do
	    ...
	done
</pre></blockquote>
The <tt>ARG_MAX</tt> warning applies to other constructs than 
<tt>for</tt> loops too, of course. Generally, commands that look like
<blockquote><pre>	command `other command`
</pre></blockquote>
are usually safer with <tt>xargs</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>	other command | xargs command
</pre></blockquote>
The classic example is running something on each one of a number of files
listed by <tt>find</tt>. An additional problem here is that <tt>find</tt> 
might find files whose names contain line breaks. GNU <tt>find</tt> can
even cope with that, by using the null character as the file name separator.
<blockquote><pre>	# Note that we use -print0 instead of -print
	# This is a GNU find -specific option
	# Similarly, the -0 option to xargs is a GNU feature
	find -options -more -options -print0 |
	xargs -r0 command
</pre></blockquote>
With normal <code>find</code>, a user could create a file with 
a newline in its name, tricking you into, well, at least missing that
file, and potentially something a lot more dangerous. (Imagine that
you have a nightly <code>cron</code> job which runs as root and which
removes old files from <code>/tmp</code>. Now imagine that a malicious
user creates a directory in <code>/tmp</code> whose name ends in newline,
and in that directory creates <code>etc/</code> and <code>etc/passwd</code>.
Then wait for it to grow old, or modify the inode's date stamp with
<code>touch</code>&nbsp;...)
<p>
In case something is still not obvious, the only disallowed file name
characters under Unix are the null character and slash. If a file is
called something like <code>/tmp/moo&lt;newline&gt;/etc/passwd</code>,
normal <code>find /tmp -print</code> would output
</p><blockquote><pre>/tmp/moo
/etc/passwd
</pre></blockquote>
and <code>xargs</code> would see two file names here. Changing the record
separator to ASCII 0 means it's now valid for a file name to span
multiple lines, so this becomes a non-issue.
<h3>
<a name="test">
Useless Use of Test
</a></h3>
This was suggested by Chris Thompson in 
<a href="news:comp.unix.shell"><tt>comp.unix.shell</tt>:</a>
<blockquote>
All these UUOC postings remind me of one of my least favourite constructs in
(Bourne, FTSOE) shell scripts:
<blockquote><pre>	mangle the world
	if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then 
	    echo "Oh dear, mangling the world failed horribly" \
	        &gt;&amp;2  # shortened, stderr redirection by your humble HTMLizer
	    putback the world
	    exit 255
	fi
</pre></blockquote>
when
<blockquote><pre>	if mangle the world ; then : ; else
	    echo "Oh dear, mangling the world failed horribly" \
	        &gt;&amp;2 # I'm still here
	    putback the world
	    exit 255
	fi
</pre></blockquote>
seems to me much cleaner (even when the "then" clause can't be used in a
more economical way, or, as with some shells, omitted).
</blockquote>
(Something like this is also covered in the 
<a href="#wc"><tt>wc -l</tt> section above.)</a>

Jon LaBadie sent me the following list (thanks!):

I've been keeping it in my inbox for an embarrassing amount of time
so I thought I'd better at least move it here where people can see it.)
</small>
</p><blockquote>
Some things that bug me:
<ul>
<li>
Regular expressions used for searching (not substituting) that
begin or end with '.*'.  Actually 'anything*' or 'anything?'.
If you are willing to accept "zero repetitions" of the anything,
why specify it?
</li><li>
Awk scripts that are basically cut unless reordering of fields
is needed.
</li><li>
Case conversions in comp.unix.shell (ex. how do I change
my file names from UC to LC?) using tr/sed/awk/??? when
some shells have builtin case conversions.
</li><li>
Complex schemes to basically eliminate certain chars.  For
example DOS lines to UNIX lines.  Sure read dos2unix(1),
but using sed/awk/... when "tr -d '^M'" is all that is needed.
</li><li>
Global changes to a file using sed to create a tmp file and
renaming the tmp file, when an "ed(1)" here document would
do fine.
</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Frederick J. Sena comments;
</p><blockquote>
I <em>really</em> hate useless "kill -9"'s
and "rm -fr"'s!
After that, the next most annoying thing
is people who use a useless "chmod 777"
to make a file writable.
</blockquote>
That's a good observation and
another example of the same pattern;
having only the heavy-duty sledgehammer
in your toolbox, and breaking all
the smaller nails with it.
<p>
Frederick also remarks:
</p><blockquote>
I disagree with your awk/cut comment,
as I often use awk for everything
and cut for nothing
because the syntax for awk is so much
cleaner for one liners and
I don't have to RTFM so much.
</blockquote>
I'll counter that 
awk is overkill,
and you don't need to reread the cut manual after
you've read it once or twice; that's my experience.
Also cut much more clearly conveys to the reader
what is going on -- a small awk script
certainly should not take a lot of time to decode,
but if you do it <em>too</em> quickly,
there might be subtle points which are easy to miss.
By contrast, cut doesn't have those subtleties,
for better or for worse.
